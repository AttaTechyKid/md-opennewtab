# MD - Open in a new tab
Hello there! Today I will teach you how to make your README.md hyperlinks open in a new tab, it has been very hard to figure this out. This is the only method out there.<br>
This project is open-source, so fork and do whatever you want!<br>
I just want to let you know, this does not work on Safari due to the security of the browser, **this requires pop-ups to be enabled!**
<br>
First the link for this is ``` https://attatechykid.github.io/md-opennewtab/ ```. Now we need to add a ``` ? ``` to identify a JavaScript argument, then, ``` link= ```. Together, that would be the link that would open in a new tab.
